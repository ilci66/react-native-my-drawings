# A react native app for me to view my own drawings
* Decided to add the object types here to my drawings, and update the database from the app
* Add scrollview and a cards for each drawing in the database with a button that lets me add object type
* Decided to limit the edits to only the drawn objects
* There will be a 2 types limit in the array
# The app is at this very basic form doing what I need it to do so moving on to other projects, now I have a better idea on workings of react native

# Edit My Drawing Types

## Project Description
A React native gallery app that allows me, the user, to edit the drawing types. The images can be viewed 
in the gallery option and can be edited in the scrollview. A drawing can only have 2 types


### Motivation
I wanted to create an app where I could practice both react native and postgreSQL 

### Technologies Used:
*   **React-Native** 
*   **PostgreSQL**, for saving drawing and type information 
*   **sequelize**, for interacting with the database

### Challanges and Improvements
*   After using react, react native felt sort of limiting but I went through with the project
*   I had some experince with SQL so setting up database and interacting with it through <br>sequelize wasn't too hard
*   The filter by type functionality can be added in the future to get the drawings I want  


### How to Install and Run the Project
1.  Clone the git repository
2.  Run "npm install" both in the root and in the backend 
3.  Don't forget to install and run the [drawing api](https://github.com/ilci66/my-drawings-api)
4.  Run "npm start" 
5.  Enjoy ;)

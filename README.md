# A react native app for me to view my own drawings
* Decided to add the object types here to my drawings, and update the database from the app
* Add scrollview and a cards for each drawing in the database with a button that lets me add object type, after your break, you are on vacation!
* Don't forget to add the image file type to the url, fixed the error
* Able to load the images and map the into cards but image sizes are not right, gonna add another key value pair to the drawings in the database so The sizing can be handled 
* Edit button should open a new screen and edits should be done with a form already pupolated with the given informations
